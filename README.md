Hello. This is a personal project I've been working slowly on for a while. The original idea was me to learn ReactJS and React-router while creating a somewhat replica of https://usa.gov. This is not done yet, and this is in NO shape a responsive website yet. I will probably have to refactor it while getting rid of most of the pre-existing source code at some date in future.

**Installation:**

Clone the Github project using either SSH or HTTPS:

> SSH:  `git@github.com:AIndoria/ResPublicaRomana.git`
> 
> HTTPS: `https://github.com/AIndoria/ResPublicaRomana.git`

Then navigate to the ResPublicaRomana directory and type `npm install`


**ToDo:**

- Add appropriate office pages
- Add voter registration request form
- Prompt users to login to perform sensitive tasks
- Add indication to let users know which page they are on
- Add accessibility options
- Add "Low Internet Usage" text-only version
